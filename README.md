# LUCA: Testing the theory of less walking equals more working

Corporal activities are beneficial for the fitness of the organisms. For example, walking has been considered a healthy occupation for humankind because it promotes blood flow and cell activation while keeping the physical stress low. The simultaneous and coordinated movement of arms and legs consists of a simple effort with excellent properties for the body.  
The benefits of walking extend also to the mind because well-being of human civilisation is still firmly based on the never-tested-belief _mens sana in corpore sano_.  
Walking can also be perceived as a leisure activity and this might interfere with the current view on productivity and social status.
